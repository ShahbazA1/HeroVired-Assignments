2.1 Entity Relationships User, Blog Post, Comment, and Tag entities with appropriate relationships using annotations like @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @ManyToMany.

@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author")
    private List<BlogPost> blogPosts;
}

@Entity
public class BlogPost {
    @ManyToOne
    private User author;
    @ManyToMany
    private List<Tag> tags;
}

@Entity
public class Comment {
    @ManyToOne
    private BlogPost post;
}
@Entity
public class Tag {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "tags")
    private List<BlogPost> blogPosts;
};



2.2 Spring Data JPA Repositories Create Spring Data JPA repositories for each entity to enable CRUD operations and complex queries. You can define a repository interface for each entity, and Spring Data JPA will provide basic CRUD methods.

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
